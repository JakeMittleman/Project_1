## Welcome to Ogetarts!
Ogetarts is a game of strategy. The idea is either to capture your opponent's base (the number 12 token), or eliminate all of their pieces with numbers 1-10. Players take turns moving pieces until the game is over.

Player 1 is red
Player 2 is blue

## The Ranks
In Ogetarts, usually a higher numbered piece beats a lower numbered piece with a couple of exceptions.

 - If 1 attacks 10, 1 wins
 - If 3 attacks 11, 3 wins
 - If two pieces of equal rank attack eachother, both lose
 - If any piece attacks 12, that player wins
 
  Here are the rank names with how many pieces exist on the board:
  1. Stealth Agent (x1)
  2. Surveyor (x8)
  3. Defuser (x5)
  4. Rookie (x4)
  5. Junior (x4)
  6. Sophomore (x4)
  7. Senior (x3)
  8. Head Agent (x2)
  9. Director (x1)
  10. Base Leader (x1)
  11. Mine (x6)
  12. Base (x1)

## Movement
Player 1 (red) can move by selecting a tile and then selecting where they want that tile to move. Pieces 11 and 12 cannot move as 11 is a mine and 12 is a base token. Most ranks can only move 1 space in any cardinal direction except for the following pieces:

  - 11 and 12 cannot move as they are not alive
  - 2 can move any number of spaces in any cardinal direction
